The top overal seed is obviously 1, the second 1 seed, on the opposite side of the bracket is 2, on the same side of the bracket is the third overall and then the fourth overall 1 seed is on the same side as the 1st overall seed. This means that the 5th overall seed is the \"best\" 2 seed and get the \"wrost\" 1 seed. and then the process is cyclic, rotating around the tournament from 1 to 64.
