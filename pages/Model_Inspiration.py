I had Virginia     winning it all and that was the year they decided to lose to UMBC in the first round.         The next year I was in a Machine Learning class at BYU taught by Tyler Folkman PhD,     and I thought it would be a good way to not only do a project in an area that I love (sports)     but also make it possible so that I dont get punked again.    This model is dedicated to Tyler Folkman for providing the platform and opportuity     for the project, and my cousin Caroline for reminding me every year that she beat me :)     Also shout out to my buddy Noah Brown who helped me write this back when we     were just learning and did everything in the most inefficient way as possible.         Cheers    ''')    images = ["viz/cuzzo.png", 'viz/n7.jpeg']st.image(images, width = 350)
